# Minamoto's Revenge
 A rogue-lite style game in which you have to fight against hordes of opponents of Japanese mythology. 
## Gameplay description
With each run, the level is randomly generated, which allows the player to feel new every time. 
Upon entering the room, it will close and enemies will appear that must be killed to complete the room. As a result, the player will receive one of the rewards:

1. Golden coins
2. Essences
3. Dead coins
