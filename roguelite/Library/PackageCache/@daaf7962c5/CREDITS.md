* Many thanks to Erik Nordeus (https://www.habrador.com) for his tutorials about triangulation and his permission to "do with the code whatever you want".
His contributions saved me quite some time when developing the polygon triangulation part of this project.
* Special thanks to @juanitogan for improvement suggestions and bug reports.
